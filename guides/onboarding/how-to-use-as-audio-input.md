# How to use Izabela as an audio input?

Izabela can be used as an audio input on any application that can receive audio from a microphone.

You only need 2 things to make this work:

- A virtual audio cable installed
- Configure the virtual audio cable as an audio output in Izabela

## Install a virtual audio cable

> You can skip this step if you already have a virtual audio cable installed.

You can install a virtual audio cable directly from Izabela in the settings.

- Go to the settings
- Go to the `Audio` tab under `Speech`
- Under "Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable", click on the "Install" button to launch the installer
